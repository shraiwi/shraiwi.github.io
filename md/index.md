# Welcome!

My name is Shranav, and I'm an 18-year-old who likes to code.

## Projects
Here's a few projects I'm proud of:

- [**Project Tracer**](project-tracer.html): Low-cost, privacy-preserving contact tracing for the masses.
- [**ATTiny555**](https://hackaday.io/project/183013-attiny555): A drop-in replacement for a 555 timer made out of an ATTiny85, because I could.
- [**Mini QOI**](https://github.com/shraiwi/mini-qoi): A streaming, statically allocated QOI decoder for embedded systems with very little RAM.

I'm currently working on a 1 kilowatt eBike ESC, but that's still a work-in-progress.
