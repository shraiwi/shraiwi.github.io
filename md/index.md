# Welcome!

You've reached my personal ePortfolio. Take a look around, and you can understand my skills, interests and a selection of some of my favorite projects.

## Skills

*If it has less storage than a floppy disk, I'm at home.*

- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Years of coding at a young age helped me apply my skills everywhere.
- **Adapting**: I'm completely self-taught in all of my programming experience, as well as my electrical engineering skills.
- **Programming**: C, C++, Python, Rust, JavaScript, and much more!
- **PCB Design**: KiCad, Altium
- **3D Design**: OnShape, Fusion360
- **Command-Line Tools**: `ffmpeg`, `imagemagick`, and a whole bunch of Linux stuff.

## Projects
Here's a few projects I'm proud of:

- [**Project Tracer**](project-tracer.html): Low-cost, privacy-preserving contact tracing for the masses.
- [**ATTiny555**](https://hackaday.io/project/183013-attiny555): A drop-in replacement for a 555 timer made out of an ATTiny85, because I could. It was featured on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2021/12/15/you-can-always-use-an-attiny-instead-of-a-555/), [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/attiny555-replaces-555-timers-with-a-microcontroller-that-simulates-555s-93ace871f17d), and [the Hackaday Podcast](https://hackaday.com/2021/12/17/hackaday-podcast-149-ballerina-bot-balances-flexures-track-cat-food-pcb-goes-under-the-knife-and-an-attiny-does-the-555/) (20:11)

- [**Mini QOI**](https://github.com/shraiwi/mini-qoi): A streaming, statically allocated QOI decoder for embedded systems with very little RAM.
- [**Sunrise Lamp**](/sunrise-lamp.html): A sunrise lamp designed for lofted dorm beds to help me get up in the morning and stop missing class!
- **My EBike**: I'm currently working on a 1 kilowatt eBike ESC, but that's still a work-in-progress.

## Career Goals

### Goal 1: Study abroad in Shenzhen

Through GT's study abroad program, I plan on studying overseas during the summer of my second year at Georgia Tech. I have to:

1. Apply for a study abroad program
2. Attend classes at GT Shenzhen

### Goal 2: Work at a large semiconductor firm

I want to gain valuable work experience at a semiconductor manufacturer, as I feel that I lack workplace experience. I have to:

1. Gain coursework experience to aid in job search
2. Apply to jobs over the summer
3. Take advantage of a co-op program or something similar to work

### Goal 3: Launch a product

I want to launch a product, whether it be a sunrise lamp or custom e-bike. This one is nebulous, but if you read my [bio](about.html) there's plenty of things I'm passionate about that I can pursue. I want to create something that makes the world better.
