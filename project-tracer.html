      <p>Project Tracer is an ESP32-based low-power contact tracing
      device that is compatible with the Google-Apple Exposure
      Notification Protocol. It is completely privacy-preserving and can
      work independently from a smartphone, but retains cross-device
      contact tracing functionality.</p>

      <h2 id="the-source-idea">The Source Idea</h2>
      <p>Most people have phones. So, what if instead of relying on
      people to identify people, we can use phones? This is exactly the
      idea behind the contact tracing standard being developed by Apple
      and Google, in a partnership. Their idea is to use a phone's BLE
      (Bluetooth Bow Energy) radio to transmit and scan for encrypted
      data. In the case of a positive diagnosis, a user can see if and
      when they've been in contact with someone with COVID-19, but not
      <em>who,</em> which allows for completely private and secure
      contact tracing.</p>
      <p>In theory, it makes sense. But, in practice, there are some
      issues with this approach:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Not everyone has a phone.</li>
      <li>Some phones do not have a BLE radio or compatible
      software.</li>
      <li>Phones have poor battery life (1-2 days at best)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With this in mind, I came up with a solution: Project Tracer.
      It is a small sized, low-power device which implements the
      aforementioned contact tracing standard.</p>
      <h2 id="what-are-the-benefits">What Are the Benefits?</h2>
      <p>As opposed to other methods of contact tracing, Project Tracer
      has multiple benefits.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>üîê Ensures User Privacy</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Unlike other methods of contact tracing that use machine vision
      or GPS, no personally-identifying data will ever be recorded or
      stored by the device. All of the information used to notify others
      of potential exposures is randomly generated and encrypted.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>üîã Long Battery Life</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Project Tracer provides an extremely low-maintenance method of
      contact tracing as opposed to phones. While a user's phone may run
      out of battery after less than a day, Project Tracer's projected
      power consumption can keep the device running for almost 5 days.
      In fact, the average power consumption is so low that the device
      can be charged by a single solar cell!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>üëê Simple Setup</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Just tap a button, connect to the hotspot, and configure the
      device!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>üí≤ Low Cost</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p>While the BOM cost for a single device in individual quantities
      is high (about $13), bulk pricing can bring the price down to
      something as low as $5 per device.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="how-does-it-work">How Does it Work?</h2>
      <p>Before getting into the project, it's important to understand
      the fundamental principles which are the backbone of the
      project:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Encryption is a one-way transformation that can only be
      reversed by the encryption key.</li>
      <li>Cryptographically secure random numbers are completely random
      and cannot be predicted in any way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With these concepts in mind, Here's how the system works.</p>
      <p>Every day, a random number called the TEK (Temporary Exposure
      Key) is generated. From the TEK, two additional keys are
      generated: the RPIK (Rolling Proximity Identifier Key) and AEMK
      (Associated Encrypted Metadata Key).</p>
      <p>Every 10 minutes, the RPIK is used to encrypt the string
      "EN-RPI", along with the UNIX epoch time at encryption into what's
      called an RPI (Rolling Proximity Identifier). Additionally, the
      system will use the AEMK and the RPI to encrypt some additional
      metadata into what's called the AEM (Associated Encrypted
      Metadata). The AEM and RPI are then combined and transmitted by
      the integrated Bluetooth Low Energy Radio to nearby devices.</p>
      <p>When the device would like to check whether or not it has been
      exposed to an individual with COVID-19, it simply starts by
      downloading the TEKs which have been submitted to a keyserver. For
      each TEK downloaded, it derives its respective RPIK and AEMK and
      attempts to decrypt the data that has been scanned from nearby
      devices. Due to the nature of Bluetooth (radio waves only travel
      so far), it is possible for the device to determine whether or not
      the user has been exposed to someone with COVID-19.</p>
      <p>If you want a more in-depth read, and also how exactly to
      implement the standard, please take a look at some of the
      documents <a

      part of the standard outlined above is the <a
